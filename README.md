# Structure-Sensitivity-and-Chemical-Applicability
Smoothness is one of the most important properties of a topological index that says the value of a molecular descriptor should uniformly change with gradual changes in molecular structure. Two novel graph structural measures namely structure sensitivity (denoted as SS) and abruptness (symbolized as Abr) were proposed to inspect the smoothness of a molecular descriptor. These structural measures give insight into the quality and prediction potential of topological indices.

Here, the Supplementary materials (Tables, Figures, Algorithm), input data and MATLAB script files used to study the structure sensitivity and chemical applicability of the novel topological indices are given. These data are associated with the paper V. Kumar, S. Das, On Structure Sensitivity and Chemical Applicability of Some Novel Degree-based Topological Indices, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem., Submitted.
