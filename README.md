# Structure-Sensitivity-and-Chemical-Applicability
Smoothness is one of the most important properties of a topological index that says the value of a molecular descriptor should uniformly change with gradual changes in molecular structure. Two novel graph structural measures namely structure sensitivity (denoted as SS) and abruptness (symbolized as Abr) were proposed to inspect the smoothness of a molecular descriptor. These structural measures give insight into the quality and prediction potential of topological indices.

Tables, Algorithm, and Figures given in this supplementary material are used to study the structure sensitivity and chemical applicability of the novel topological indices in the paper V. Kumar, S. Das, On Structure Sensitivity and Chemical Applicability of Some Novel Degree-based Topological Indices, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem., Communicated.
